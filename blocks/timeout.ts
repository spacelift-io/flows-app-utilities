    "Creates cancellable delayed events that emit after a specified time period.\n\n" +
    "How it works:\n" +
    "1. Start timer: Send event with delay → receives timer ID immediately\n" +
    "2. Wait period: Timer runs in background for specified duration\n" +
    "3. Timeout event: After delay, emits event on timeouts output\n" +
    "4. Optional cancel: Use timer ID to cancel before timeout occurs\n\n" +
    "Key features:\n" +
    "- Immediate response: Start input emits timer ID right away\n" +
    "- Delayed execution: Actual timeout event comes later\n" +
    "- Cancellable: Stop timers before they fire using the timer ID\n" +
    "- Non-blocking: Multiple timers can run simultaneously\n\n" +
    "Common uses:\n" +
    "- User interaction timeouts: Cancel operations if no user response\n" +
    "- Rate limiting: Enforce minimum delays between actions\n" +
    "- Batch processing: Collect events for a period then process\n" +
    "- Circuit breakers: Reset error states after cooldown periods\n" +
    "- Session expiry: Auto-logout users after inactivity\n" +
    "- Reminder systems: Send notifications after delays\n" +
    "- Cleanup tasks: Trigger maintenance after time periods",
