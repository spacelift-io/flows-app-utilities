    "Combines data from two separate event streams by matching events with the same key.\n\n" +
    "How it works:\n" +
    "- Primary events: Arrive first and wait for matching secondary events\n" +
    "- Secondary events: Bring payload data to merge with waiting primary events\n" +
    "- Matching: Events matched using identical keys from both streams\n" +
    "- Timeout: Primary events timeout if no secondary match arrives\n\n" +
    "Event flow:\n" +
    "1. Primary event arrives with matching key → waits for secondary\n" +
    "2. Secondary event with same key → merges immediately with waiting primary\n" +
    "3. If no match within timeout → primary emits with `matched: false`\n" +
    "4. If secondary has no waiting primary → emits to unmatched output\n\n" +
    "Common uses:\n" +
    "- Request/response correlation: Match API requests with their responses\n" +
    "- Multi-step workflows: Combine user actions with system responses\n" +
    "- Data enrichment: Add details from secondary source to primary events\n" +
    "- Approval workflows: Match requests with approval decisions\n" +
    "- Order processing: Combine orders with payment confirmations",

        "- Primary events timeout if no secondary match arrives in time\n" +
        "- Timeout triggers emission with `matched: false` and `payload: null`\n" +
